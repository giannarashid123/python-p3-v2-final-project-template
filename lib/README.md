# Language Learning CLI App

## Project Overview

This is a command-line interface (CLI) application designed to help users learn new languages interactively. Users can create accounts, track their learning progress, complete lessons, and take quizzes to reinforce their knowledge. The app saves progress so learners can pick up where they left off.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the use of Python CLI development, databases with SQLAlchemy, and user interaction through terminal prompts.
